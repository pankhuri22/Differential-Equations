# Scientific Computing 

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of Linear ALgebra techniques and algorithms for matrix related computations in Python and NumPy : 
* Gaussian elimination and partial pivoting 
* Scaling a Linear System
* Perturbed Linear Systems 
* Least Squares fitting with Gram-Schmidt and QR
* Eigenvalue finding using:
  1. power iteration
  2. inverse ietration
  3. Rayleigh quotient iteration
  4. QR iteration, etc.
* Principal Component Analysis


## Repository Structure 
* Directory [Gaussian elimination](https://github.com/pankhuri22/Scientific-Computing-/tree/master/Gaussian%20elimination) contains scripts for performing gaussian elimination on a matrix using no pivoting and partial pivoting methods.
